# STM32_Memory-Game-C
A memory game developed in C for the STM32F103C8T6 microcontroller. It uses 3 LEDs, 3 buttons, and a buzzer. The game generates a random blinking sequence on the LEDs, and the player's goal is to replicate it using the buttons. The project was implemented with STM32CubeMX and PlatformIO in Neovim.
